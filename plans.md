    - Events as provided by Sarna:
        - Initial Proposal and Secret Provision (3020 - 3022) [Retroactive Event, triggers at start]: In 3020, Archon Katrina Steiner of the Lyran Commonwealth issued a Peace Proposal to the Great Houses of the Inner Sphere. First Prince Hanse Davion of the Federated Suns responded, leading to the signing of the FedCom Accords in 3022. These accords included a secret provision for the marriage of Hanse and Archon-Designate Melissa Steiner, which would unite the two states​.
        - Marriage and Formal Union (3028 - 3030): The marriage of Hanse and Melissa in 3028 marked a significant step towards unification. This union, initially known as the Federated Commonwealth Alliance, began to bind the two realms together. Following their marriage, the Fourth Succession War started, leading to significant territorial gains and further solidification of the union​.
        - Birth of Victor Steiner-Davion and Political Integration (3030): On April 12, 3030, Melissa gave birth to Victor Steiner-Davion, the future ruler of the Federated Commonwealth. The political and military integration of the two states accelerated in anticipation of Victor's future leadership​.
        - Secession of the Lyran Half (3057): In 3057, a political crisis ensued when Victor Steiner-Davion used a body double in a deceptive maneuver involving Thomas Marik. This led to Katherine Steiner-Davion seceding the Lyran half of the Federated Commonwealth and renaming it the Lyran Alliance, claiming her brother had tarnished the Commonwealth's name​.
    - Technical Aspects:
        - Renaming Ruler Title to 
        - Renaming Ruler to "[Forename] Steiner-Davion
